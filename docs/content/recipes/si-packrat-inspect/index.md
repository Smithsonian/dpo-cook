The `si-packrat-inspect` recipe is similar to the `inspect-mesh` recipe in that it generates and returns a report with mesh statistics and other properties for the provided scene, 
but with attributes and naming conventions tailored to consumption by the [Smithsonian Packrat](https://github.com/Smithsonian/dpo-packrat) data management system.

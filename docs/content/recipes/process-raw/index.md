The `photogrammetry` recipe takes zip files of raw image sets (.raw, .cr2, or any format understood by the tool in use) and converts them to jpg and white balances/color corrects based on provided parameters. This is useful in conjunction with photogrammetry work to increase the color accuracy of your resulting texture.

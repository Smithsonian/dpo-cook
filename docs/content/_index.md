## 3D data processing made easy.

Processing 3D models can be tedious. For tasks such as mesh decimation, creation of UV coordinates, map baking, and file conversion, dozens of tools are available. There is currently no "one size fits all" solution. Often it takes a lot of expertise, time and patience to find a chain of tools which work nicely together.

The Cook simplifies the processing of 3D model, mesh, and texture data by providing a simplified interface for about a dozen of the most widely used processing tools. Recipes define processing workflows, where a set of files is processed by multiple tools.

The Cook is implemented as a Node.js server and can be controlled via web API, a web user interface, or via command line tool.
